  @monaco-editor/react loads monaco from CDN by default.
  This file is just a placeholder to acknowledge we considered local setup.
  For simplicity and speed, we will stick to CDN loading which @monaco-editor/react does automatically.
  If the user wants offline support later, we can configure the loader.
